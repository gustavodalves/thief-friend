# Secret Santa Drawing System - TypeScript Project

This project implements a Secret Santa drawing system, a common game during the Christmas season. In this game, participants become "Secret Santas" for each other, gifting without revealing their identities.

## Project Structure

The project is written in TypeScript and features the following key components:

### Aggregate

- `ThiefFriend`: A class that inherits from `AggregateRoot` and manages the Secret Santa drawing. It includes methods for performing the drawing, registering participants, and retrieving information about the drawing.

## Unit Tests

The project includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the implemented functionality.
